# purpose

I've benn interested in learning, brainstorming, getting new ideas by entering in words and have them spin, round-and-round

The idea is that reading words stimulates thoughts, even if we read the same set of words over and over

It can be meditative and thinking about words will naturally give ideas for other words and other ideas

By keeping it scrolling, it keeps everything paced and continuously repeating in order

I think it can also help memorize a list of words, simply by seeing them move over and over

Another thought is that words might be better memorized when we trace our eyes "smooth pursuit" on moving words

The whole "smooth pursuit" of memorizing moving words better was an idea I thought of while watching Dr Huberman talk about eyes on YouTube

I took my finger and focused on it as I moved it across my fear, and though, "wow, I bet I would remember something better focusing on it like that"
